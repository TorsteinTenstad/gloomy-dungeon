Balancing (early game):
- BoodboundHarness forces a relationship between Health and Stamina.
  Assuming 3 normal turns should drain about half heath, we need Health == 6*Stamina
- Basic abilities yield +-1 damage. This having a 20% impact feels good, meaning that early game attacks should deal 5 damage.
- Since we want combos and multi-card play, typical round damage will probably be around 12.
- It feels good for the enemies have only slightly weaker attacks. Assume average 5 damage per enemy per round.
- The player will on average fight 4 "normal strength" enemies per encounter.
- Encounters should average 8 rounds. Assuming linear killing, this means taking 4+3+3+2+2+1+1 = 20 hits
- With ignorant play, this is 100 damage. Assuming good plays, 60 Health should be good. This means 10 Stamina
- With 12 damage from the player per round, enemies should average 24 health.
